        <h2>My Cats:</h2>
          <p> I used to own two kittens which I had seen grown up before my eyes as while taking care of them. They were always greedy for food and loved playing with one another. They would hide under anything possible such as under the bed, under the table, under the dresser, etc. They were the two cutest cats ever.</p>
        <h2>Lore:</h2>
          <p>I used to not like cats as I had only ever had a dog and thought that only dogs were the best. After having a cat and warming up to them I have started liking having a cat as a pet. They aren't as aggressive as dogs and are more or less more laid back than the average dog. They also show affection in their own cute unique way.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
          <p>I ended up enjoying cats as companions more than dogs which I used to enjoy as companions more. Cats are just not as much as an issue as dogs nor as smelly as them either. Cats are naturally easier to take care of than dogs anytime. So I would enjoy having a cat.</p>
